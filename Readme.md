[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/autod.svg)](https://nodei.co/npm/autod/)

Auto generate dependencies and devDependencies by parse the project file.
`autod` will parse all the js files in `path`, and get the latest dependencies version from [registry.npm.taobao.org](http://registry.npm.taobao.org) or other registries by `-r`.

## install

```bash
$ npm install -g autod
```

## usage

```bash
$ bin/autod -h

  Usage: autod [options]

  Options:

    -h, --help                           output usage information
    -p, --path [folder path]             the folder path to be parse
    -t, --test <test folder path>        the test folder path to be parse
    -e, --exclude <exclude folder path>  exclude parse folder, split by `,`
    -r, --registry <remote registry>     get latest version from which registry
    -f, --prefix [version prefix]        version prefix, can be `~` or `^`
    -w, --write                          write dependencies into package.json
    -i, --ignore                         ignore errors, display the dependencies or write the dependencies.
    -m, --map                            display all the dependencies require by which file
    -d, --dep <dependence modules>       modules that not require by file, but you really need them
    -k, --keep <dependencies modules>    modules that you want to keep version in package.json file
    -a, --arbitrary [dependence type]    ignore the devDependencies module, if it is set to `*`, can be `dev`
```

* Autod will parse all the js files in `path`, and you can exclude folder by `-e, --exclude`.
* All the modules in test folder (can be alter by `-t, --text`) will parsed as devDependencies.
* If you set `-w, --write`, `autod` will write the dependencies into package.json file. `dependencies` will replace `dependencies` in package.json, and `devDependencies` will merge with `devDependencies` in package.json, then write into package file.
* `-f, --prefix` will add prefix to each dependencies' version.
* `-i, --ignore` will display or wrtie the dependencies even some error happened.
* `-d --dep` will add modules to package.json even not require by any file.
* `-k --keep` will keep the modules' version in package.json not change by autod.
